LPCG Options:

**defaultLinesOfContext**, **defaultLinesToRecite**, **defaultLinesInGroupsOf**: These control the values in the respective spin boxes when you open the LPCG import dialog. If you regularly like to use different values than the defaults (2, 1, and 1), you can set them here and avoid having to tweak them every time.
**endOfStanzaMarker**: This string will be added at the end of the last line of each stanza. It should normally begin with a space so it isnâ€™t squashed against the end of the last word on the line.
**endOfTextMarker**: Like *endOfStanzaMarker*, but appears at the end of the last line of the entire text.
