Anki **Lyrics/Poetry Cloze Generator** (LPCG)
is an add-on for `Anki`_
for studying long passages of verbatim text, like poetry or song lyrics.

For clarity, throughout this documentation, we’ll discuss “poetry,”
but everything applies equally
to songs, speeches, or any other text you might want to memorize.
